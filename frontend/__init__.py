WL_DISCLAIMER = """At NMBGMR, we use different tools to collect groundwater level measurements, including continuous 
data recorders and manual measurements. All data provided here are in feet, depth to water, below ground surface (BGS). 
We use pressure transducers to record pressure of water over a device installed in the well, which is converted to feet 
of water and depth to water. We provide here up to one measurement per hour where the data are that frequent. In some 
locations we have more data available. We also use continuous 
acoustic sounder devices which convert a sound reflection into a measurement of depth to water. These can be used for 
long term trends in groundwater levels. While we do our best to review and 
quality check these data, please use these data with caution. Site-specific conditions should be verified, 
especially for legally binding decisions. Data are subject to changes, deletion, or being moved without notice 
at any time and should not be relied on for any critical application. Any opinions expressed may not necessarily 
reflect the official position of the New Mexico Bureau of Geology, New Mexico Tech, or the State of New Mexico. 
No warranty expressed or implied, is made regarding the accuracy or utility of the data for general or scientific purposes.
